# 🐘 WildGuardX – Smart Agro-Defense Against Wildlife Intrusions

**WildGuardX** is an open-source, AI-powered, and IoT-driven solution to **safeguard farmlands from wild elephant intrusions and crop damage**—a growing and critical issue affecting agriculture across Sri Lanka and many other regions of the world.

---

## 🌍 The Problem

Elephant intrusions into farms and villages are a **frequent and severe problem in rural Sri Lanka**. Despite the use of electric fences, many farmers face:

- ❌ **Fence malfunctions** due to power issues, physical damage, or lack of monitoring
- ❌ **Human error** in manually turning fences ON/OFF
- ❌ **Delayed response time** to damage or animal movements
- ❌ **No visibility** on fence health or elephant activity until it's too late
- ❌ **Significant crop loss and economic damage**

---

## ✅ Our Solution

**WildGuardX** addresses these challenges with a **phased, modular, and intelligent system** that automates electric fence control, monitors fence health in real time, and integrates AI-based early detection to help farmers **act before destruction happens**.

We aim to empower farmers with:

- 📡 **IoT-based smart electric fence control**
- ⚡ **Sensor-based fault detection and cluster heatmaps**
- 🤖 **AI/Computer Vision-based elephant detection**
- 🔔 **Instant alerts via SMS, WhatsApp, and Email**
- 🧠 **Offline-ready, fail-safe and energy-efficient design**
- 🛰️ **Support for GSM, NB-IoT, LoRaWAN, and multi-fallback connectivity**

## 🧱 Architecture – Phased Modular System

WildGuardX is developed in **three integrated phases**, each with its own component and repository:

| Phase | Subsystem           | Description |
|-------|---------------------|-------------|
| **1** | `wildguardx-link`   | Remote/manual/scheduled electric fence control with physical override and alert feedback |
| **2** | `wildguardx-pulse`  | Real-time voltage/current monitoring, sensor fault detection, and cluster-based health heatmap |
| **3** | `wildguardx-vision` | AI & computer vision-based wildlife detection using edge computing (Jetson Nano/RPi + cameras) |

In addition, we support:

- **`wildguardx-dashboard`**: Web/mobile UI to manage, visualize, and analyze data
- **`wildguardx-cloud`**: MQTT brokers, REST APIs, alerting services, and backend
- **`wildguardx-hardware`**: Circuit schematics, PCBs, power systems, solar backups
- **`wildguardx-docs`**: Architecture diagrams, installation manuals, user guides
- **`wildguardx-simulations`**: Simulations and test cases for field-level validation
